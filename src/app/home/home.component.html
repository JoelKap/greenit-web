          In the contemporary era, going green is the goal of almost every top
          tech-savvy company in the world. These mainstream tech companies have
          realized that going green not only increases social corporate
          responsibility outlook and acquiring more business leads but also in
          smoothening operations and reducing the overall energy costs.

          <p>
            E-waste is a fast growing issue, with between 20-50 million tons
            being produced around the world each year. Most of this waste isn't
            processed in an effective way, and can seriously harm the
            environment of those nearby.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most effective way to reduce waste, is not create it in the
            first place. Furthermore, as much as 80% of the energy used across a
            PCâ€™s working life is expended during its manufacture, before it is
            even switched on.

          <h2>Repair</h2>
          <p>
            The right to repair has evolved from a consumer rallying cry to a
            seeming inevitability in a growing number of markets. As legislation
            passes and regulations arrive, manufacturers need to redesign their
            products and rethink supply chains and customer service. However,
            this also offers companies an opportunity to create new business
            models and demonstrate sustainability in their offerings.

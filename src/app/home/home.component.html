                    lost property report in person.

                    When you report lost property to Police you will receive a Police Acknowledgement 
                    Form (PAF) with a reference number that can be used for insurance purposes.
                    
                    Items that are handed in to Police are held for a sufficient period of time 
                    to make the necessary enquiries. Keeping serial numbers greatly improves your 
                    chances of identifying property if it is handed in.
